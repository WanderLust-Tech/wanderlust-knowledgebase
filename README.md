Built with ❤️ by the WanderLust Tech team for the Chromium development community.

’ve sketched out a React+TypeScript starter that:

Reads a simple contentIndex tree to drive a collapsible sidebar.

Fetches static Markdown files from /public/content/... and renders with react-markdown.

Uses React Router’s “catch-all” route to map any /some/path to /public/content/some/path.md.

On the content side, I’ve suggested a directory structure under public/content/:

pgsql

Each folder and file corresponds to an entry in the sidebar tree. You can expand this by:

Adding metadata (e.g., front-matter in your markdown) and switching to a loader like MDX when you’re ready for interactive examples.

Switching the static files for a headless CMS or database: you’d replace the fetch calls in ArticleView.tsx with an API client.

Styling using Tailwind (as in the example classes) or any design system you prefer.

Feel free to iterate on the contentIndex to reorder sections or add sub-topics. This skeleton should give you a clear path for both the code and the information architecture of your Chromium KB. Let me know if you’d like more detail on any part—e.g. integrating a database, customizing the tree view, or adding search.
