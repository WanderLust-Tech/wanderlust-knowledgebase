### 📚 **Documentation**
- Complete deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- Updated README with deployment instructions
- Environment configuration examples
- Troubleshooting and best practices

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Local Development & Deployment

```bash
# 1. Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your FTP credentials

# 2. Test deployment setup
npm run deploy:setup

# 3. Test FTP connection
npm run deploy:test

# 4. Build and deploy
npm run deploy
```

### GitHub Actions Setup

```bash
# 1. Add secrets to GitHub repository settings:
#    - PROD_FTP_HOST, PROD_FTP_USER, PROD_FTP_PASSWORD, etc.

# 2. Push to main/master branch
git push origin main

# 3. Check Actions tab for deployment status
```

## 📋 **Available Commands**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run deploy` | Build and deploy to FTP server |
| `npm run deploy:test` | Test FTP connection without deploying |
| `npm run deploy:backup` | Download current remote files as backup |
| `npm run deploy:staging` | Deploy to staging environment |
| `npm run deploy:production` | Deploy to production environment |
| `npm run deploy:setup` | Validate deployment configuration |

## 🔒 **Security Features**

- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Git-ignored credential files
- ✅ GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
- ✅ FTPS support for encrypted transfers
- ✅ Backup creation before deployment
- ✅ Connection validation and error handling

## 🎯 **Deployment Targets**

The system supports multiple deployment methods:

1. **FTP/FTPS** - Most common shared hosting
2. **SSH/Rsync** - VPS and dedicated servers
3. **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting for public repos
4. **Custom** - Easily extendable for other services

## 📊 **Monitoring & Logs**

- Real-time deployment progress
- Detailed error messages and troubleshooting
- GitHub Actions logs and artifacts
- Backup retention and management
- Deployment history and rollback capability

## 🔄 **Workflow Examples**

### Daily Development
```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new content"

# Deploy to staging
git push origin develop

# Deploy to production
git push origin main
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Create backup first
npm run deploy:backup

# Manually restore from GitHub Actions artifacts
# Or use FTP client to upload previous backup
```

## 📈 **Next Steps**

1. **Configure your FTP credentials** in `.env`
2. **Test the deployment** with `npm run deploy:test`
3. **Set up GitHub Secrets** for automated deployment
4. **Customize deployment paths** as needed
5. **Set up monitoring** for your deployed site

## 🛟 **Support**

- Check `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions
- Review GitHub Actions logs for CI/CD issues
- Test FTP connection with `npm run deploy:test`
- Validate setup with `npm run deploy:setup`
