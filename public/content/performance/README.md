# Performance Documentation

This section contains documentation for performance optimization, profiling, and performance analysis in Chromium.

## Profiling & Analysis

- [Profiling](profiling.md) - General profiling techniques and tools
- [Profiling Content Shell on Android](profiling_content_shell_on_android.md) - Android-specific profiling

## Optimization Techniques

- [Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)](pgo.md) - Using PGO for performance improvements
- [Order Files](orderfile.md) - Code layout optimization for improved performance

## Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring in Chromium involves:

### Key Metrics
- **Startup Time**: Time from process launch to first meaningful paint
- **Memory Usage**: Peak and sustained memory consumption
- **CPU Usage**: Processing efficiency across different workloads
- **Graphics Performance**: Frame rates and rendering efficiency

### Profiling Tools
- **Chrome DevTools**: Built-in performance profiling
- **Systrace/Perfetto**: System-level tracing on Android
- **ETW**: Event Tracing for Windows
- **Instruments**: macOS profiling tool
- **perf**: Linux performance analysis

### Optimization Strategies
- **Code Layout**: Using order files for better cache locality
- **Profile-Guided Optimization**: Compiler optimizations based on runtime profiles
- **Memory Management**: Efficient allocation and deallocation patterns
- **Threading**: Proper task distribution across threads

## Performance Best Practices

1. **Measure First**: Always profile before optimizing
2. **Target Bottlenecks**: Focus on the most impactful optimizations
3. **Consider All Platforms**: Performance characteristics vary by platform
4. **Validate Changes**: Ensure optimizations don't introduce regressions
