# APIs & Services Overview

Chromium's modern architecture relies heavily on well-defined APIs and service-oriented design. This section covers the key APIs and service architecture patterns used throughout the codebase.

## What You'll Learn

- **Mojo IPC System**: Modern inter-process communication with type safety and security
- **Service Architecture**: How Chromium's discrete service components are organized
- **API Design Patterns**: Common patterns for building robust, maintainable APIs
- **Testing Strategies**: How to test complex service interactions and Mojo interfaces

## Key Technologies

**Mojo** is Chromium's IPC system that enables communication between processes through strongly-typed interfaces. It provides:

- **Type Safety**: Compile-time interface validation
- **Performance**: Efficient message passing with shared memory
- **Security**: Process isolation with capability-based access
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across all supported platforms

**Services** are discrete components that communicate through Mojo interfaces, enabling better modularity, testing, and process isolation.
