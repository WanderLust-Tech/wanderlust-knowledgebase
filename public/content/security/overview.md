# Security & Safety

Welcome to the Security section! This area covers the comprehensive security model and safety mechanisms implemented in the Wanderlust custom Chromium browser.

## What You'll Find Here

This section provides essential security information:

- **[Security Model](security-model.md)**: Comprehensive overview of browser security architecture and principles
- **Sandboxing**: Process isolation and security boundaries
- **Permission Management**: User permission systems and access controls
- **Security Updates**: Keeping the browser secure with regular updates

## Security Principles

Our custom Chromium implementation follows these core security principles:

### Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Security Layers**: No single point of failure
- **Process Isolation**: Separate processes for different security contexts
- **Sandboxing**: Restricted execution environments for untrusted content
- **Permission Models**: Granular control over resource access

### Security by Design
- **Least Privilege**: Components operate with minimal necessary permissions
- **Secure Defaults**: Safe configurations out of the box
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all external inputs
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted channels for all sensitive data

## Key Security Components

### Process Security
- **Site Isolation**: Each site runs in its own process
- **Renderer Sandboxing**: Web content runs in restricted environments
- **Privilege Separation**: Different privilege levels for different components

### Network Security
- **TLS/HTTPS**: Secure communication protocols
- **Certificate Validation**: Robust certificate checking
- **Mixed Content Protection**: Preventing insecure content on secure pages

### Content Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Preventing code injection attacks
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Controlling cross-origin resource access
- **Subresource Integrity**: Ensuring resource authenticity

## Security Threats and Mitigations

### Common Attack Vectors
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Mitigated through CSP and input sanitization
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Protected by SameSite cookies and tokens
- **Code Injection**: Prevented through sandboxing and input validation
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Blocked by certificate pinning and HSTS

### Browser-Specific Security
- **Extension Security**: Secure extension architecture and permissions
- **Download Protection**: Scanning and validation of downloaded files
- **Safe Browsing**: Protection against malicious websites and downloads

## Integration with Browser Architecture

Security integrates deeply with:
- [Architecture](../architecture/overview.md): Security boundaries in the process model
- [Modules](../modules/overview.md): Security considerations for each module
- [Debugging](../debugging/overview.md): Security-focused debugging techniques

## Security Best Practices

For developers working on security-sensitive code:

1. **Follow Security Guidelines**: Adhere to established security coding practices
2. **Regular Security Reviews**: Code reviews with security focus
3. **Security Testing**: Comprehensive testing including security scenarios
4. **Stay Updated**: Keep informed about latest security threats and mitigations

## Compliance and Standards

Our security implementation follows:
- **Web Security Standards**: W3C and WHATWG security specifications
- **Industry Best Practices**: OWASP guidelines and recommendations
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Compliance with relevant security regulations
