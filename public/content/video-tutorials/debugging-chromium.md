## Hands-On Debugging Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Browser Crash Investigation
```bash
# Generate crash dump
ulimit -c unlimited
./out/Debug/chrome --enable-crash-reporter

# Analyze with GDB
gdb out/Debug/chrome core.12345
(gdb) bt
(gdb) frame 2
(gdb) print variable_name
```

### Scenario 2: Renderer Process Memory Leak
```bash
# Memory profiling build
gn gen out/ASan --args='is_asan=true'
ninja -C out/ASan chrome

# Run with heap profiling
export HEAPPROFILE=/tmp/chrome.heap
./out/ASan/chrome --no-sandbox
```

### Scenario 3: Performance Bottleneck Analysis
```bash
# CPU profiling
perf record -g ./out/Debug/chrome --no-sandbox
perf report

# GPU debugging
./out/Debug/chrome --enable-gpu-command-logging
```

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Custom Debug Builds
- Specialized build configurations for debugging
- Adding custom logging and assertions
- Debug-specific feature flags

### Logging and Tracing
- VLOG and DLOG usage patterns
