# Design Patterns in Chromium Architecture

Welcome to the Design Patterns section! This area documents the key design patterns and architectural patterns used throughout the Wanderlust custom Chromium browser implementation.

## What You'll Find Here

This section covers the fundamental design patterns that shape our Chromium architecture:

- **[Delegate Pattern](delegate-pattern.md)**: Delegation and callback mechanisms for flexible component interactions
- **[Factory Pattern](factory-pattern.md)**: Object creation patterns for managing complex component instantiation
- **[Observer Pattern](observer-pattern.md)**: Event notification and subscription systems
- **[Pre/Post Contract Pattern](pre-post-contract.md)**: Contracts for method preconditions and postconditions
- **[State Pattern](state-pattern.md)**: State management and state machine implementations

## Why Design Patterns Matter

In a complex codebase like Chromium, design patterns provide:

### Code Organization
- **Consistent Structure**: Predictable code organization across modules
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different responsibilities
- **Modularity**: Loosely coupled components that can evolve independently

### Maintainability
- **Common Vocabulary**: Shared understanding of architectural concepts
- **Proven Solutions**: Time-tested approaches to common problems
- **Refactoring Safety**: Patterns that support safe code evolution

### Team Collaboration
- **Design Communication**: Clear ways to express architectural intentions
- **Code Reviews**: Common patterns make code easier to review and understand
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Patterns help new team members understand the codebase

## Pattern Categories

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Managing event notifications and subscriptions
- **State Pattern**: Handling complex state transitions and behaviors
- **Delegate Pattern**: Flexible callback and delegation mechanisms

### Creational Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Controlled object creation and initialization
- **Pre/Post Contracts**: Ensuring proper object construction and usage

### Architectural Patterns
- **Component Separation**: How different browser components interact
- **Process Boundaries**: Patterns for inter-process communication
- **Security Boundaries**: Patterns that maintain security isolation

## Implementation Context

These patterns are implemented within the broader Chromium architecture:

### Process Model Integration
- Patterns work across process boundaries in multi-process architecture
- Security considerations for pattern implementations
- Performance implications of pattern choices

### Module Integration
- How patterns facilitate communication between browser modules
- Pattern usage in networking, rendering, and JavaScript execution
- Cross-module pattern consistency

## Pattern Usage Guidelines

When implementing or modifying code that uses these patterns:

1. **Understand the Intent**: Know why the pattern was chosen for specific use cases
2. **Follow Conventions**: Maintain consistency with existing pattern implementations
3. **Consider Performance**: Understand the performance implications of pattern choices
4. **Respect Boundaries**: Ensure patterns don't violate security or process boundaries

## Learning Path

For developers new to these patterns:

1. **Start with Observer**: Most commonly encountered in browser event systems
2. **Study Delegate**: Critical for understanding callback mechanisms
3. **Explore Factory**: Important for component creation and initialization
4. **Advanced Patterns**: Pre/Post contracts and State patterns for complex scenarios

## Integration with Architecture

These design patterns integrate with:
- [Architecture Overview](../overview.md): How patterns fit into overall system design
- [Process Model](../process-model.md): Patterns in multi-process architecture
- [IPC Internals](../ipc-internals.md): Communication patterns between processes
- [Security Architecture](../security/overview.md): Security-aware pattern implementations

## Practical Applications

Each pattern documentation includes:
- **Real-world Examples**: Actual usage in the Chromium codebase
- **Implementation Details**: Code examples and best practices
- **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid when using each pattern
- **Performance Considerations**: Impact on browser performance
