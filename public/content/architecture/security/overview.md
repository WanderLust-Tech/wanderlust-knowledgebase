# Security Architecture

Welcome to the Security Architecture section! This area provides detailed technical documentation about the security architecture and implementation within the Wanderlust custom Chromium browser.

## What You'll Find Here

This section focuses on the architectural aspects of browser security:

- **[Sandbox Architecture](sandbox-architecture.md)**: Detailed technical implementation of browser sandboxing and process isolation
- **Security Boundaries**: How security boundaries are maintained across browser components
- **Process Isolation**: Technical details of multi-process security architecture
- **Privilege Separation**: Implementation of least-privilege principles

## Security Architecture Overview

The security architecture of our custom Chromium browser is built on several key principles:

### Multi-Process Security Model
- **Process Isolation**: Each major component runs in its own process with limited privileges
- **Sandbox Boundaries**: Strict sandboxing prevents processes from accessing unauthorized resources
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Secure communication channels between isolated processes
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention**: Architecture prevents unauthorized privilege increases

### Sandboxing Implementation
- **Renderer Sandboxing**: Web content runs in heavily sandboxed renderer processes
- **System Resource Isolation**: Limited access to file system, network, and system APIs
- **GPU Process Sandboxing**: Graphics operations isolated in separate sandboxed process
- **Plugin Sandboxing**: Third-party plugins run with minimal system access

## Technical Architecture Components

### Process Security Model
The browser implements a multi-layered process security model:

1. **Browser Process**: Privileged process managing other processes and system access
2. **Renderer Processes**: Sandboxed processes for web content execution
3. **GPU Process**: Isolated graphics and hardware acceleration
4. **Network Process**: Separate process for network operations
5. **Utility Processes**: Specialized processes for specific tasks

### Security Boundaries
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Enforced at the process level for strong isolation
- **Site Isolation**: Each site runs in its own dedicated process
- **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: Strict controls on cross-origin resource access
- **API Access Controls**: Limited API access based on process type and privileges

### Threat Mitigation
- **Code Injection Prevention**: Architecture prevents malicious code injection
- **Data Exfiltration Protection**: Sandboxing limits unauthorized data access
- **System Compromise Mitigation**: Isolated processes limit impact of security breaches
- **Privilege Escalation Blocks**: Multiple barriers prevent privilege escalation attacks

## Implementation Details

### Sandbox Technology
- **Operating System Integration**: Leveraging OS-specific sandboxing mechanisms
- **Capability-Based Security**: Fine-grained capability control for process operations
- **Resource Limitations**: CPU, memory, and I/O restrictions for sandboxed processes
- **System Call Filtering**: Restricted system calls for enhanced security

### Communication Security
- **IPC Security**: Secure inter-process communication mechanisms
- **Message Validation**: Strict validation of all inter-process messages
- **Authentication**: Process identity verification and authentication
- **Encryption**: Encrypted communication channels where appropriate

## Security Architecture Patterns

### Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Security Layers**: No single point of failure in security architecture
- **Redundant Protections**: Multiple mechanisms protecting against the same threats
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure default behaviors when security checks fail

### Least Privilege
- **Minimal Permissions**: Each process has only the minimum required permissions
- **Dynamic Privilege Adjustment**: Privileges adjusted based on current needs
- **Capability Dropping**: Unused capabilities are removed during process execution

## Integration with Browser Architecture

Security architecture integrates deeply with:
- [Process Model](../process-model.md): How security boundaries align with process boundaries
- [IPC Internals](../ipc-internals.md): Secure communication between processes
- [Browser Components](../browser-components.md): Security considerations for each component
- [General Security Model](../../security/overview.md): High-level security principles and policies

## Development Considerations

When working with security-sensitive code:

1. **Security Review Required**: All changes affecting security boundaries need review
2. **Threat Modeling**: Consider potential attacks and mitigation strategies
3. **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive security testing including penetration testing
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep security documentation current with implementation changes

## Security Compliance

Our security architecture adheres to:
- **Industry Standards**: Following established security architecture best practices
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Compliance with relevant security regulations
- **Security Frameworks**: Implementation based on proven security frameworks
- **Continuous Assessment**: Regular security architecture reviews and updates

## Performance Considerations

Security architecture balances security with performance:
- **Efficient IPC**: Optimized secure communication between processes
- **Resource Management**: Efficient use of system resources within security constraints
- **Caching Strategies**: Secure caching that doesn't compromise security boundaries
- **Startup Optimization**: Fast startup while maintaining security guarantees
