Any good architecture requires high cohesion, low coupling between modules, and conforms to the design principles of SOLID (single function, open-shut principle, Rickers substitution, interface isolation, and dependency inversion). Chromium as an excellent open source project, let's take a look at the main features of its architecture.

As an excellent open source project, Chromium's architectural features are most obvious module layering and adopt a multi-process model, so that module dependencies can be solved, and highly cohesive, low-coupling levels and components can be continuously developed, and deps ([code management tools](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/coding-cr?from=10680)) are used for guarantee. The basic design principle is that the underlying modules cannot depend on the higher modules, but can call their interface APIs.
