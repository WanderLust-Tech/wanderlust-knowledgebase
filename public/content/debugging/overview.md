# Debugging & Troubleshooting

Welcome to the Debugging section! This comprehensive guide helps developers debug, troubleshoot, and analyze issues in the Wanderlust custom Chromium browser.

## What You'll Find Here

This section provides essential debugging tools and techniques:

- **[Chrome Internals URLs](chrome-internals-urls.md)**: Access internal Chrome debugging pages and diagnostic tools
- **[Command Line Switches](command-line-switches.md)**: Comprehensive guide to Chrome command line flags for debugging and development
- **[Crash Reports](crash-reports.md)**: Understanding, generating, and analyzing crash reports
- **[Debugging Tools](debugging-tools.md)**: Essential tools and techniques for effective debugging

## Debugging Workflow

When encountering issues in your Chromium development:

1. **Identify the Problem**: Reproduce the issue and gather initial information
2. **Use Internal Tools**: Leverage Chrome's built-in debugging URLs and tools
3. **Analyze Logs**: Check console output, crash reports, and diagnostic information
4. **Apply Debugging Tools**: Use specialized debugging tools for deeper analysis

## Common Debugging Scenarios

- **Browser Crashes**: Use crash report analysis and debugging symbols
- **Performance Issues**: Profile using Chrome DevTools and internal performance pages
- **Network Problems**: Debug using network internals and protocol analysis
- **Rendering Issues**: Inspect the rendering pipeline and GPU processes
- **JavaScript/V8 Issues**: Debug the V8 engine and JavaScript execution

## Quick Access to Debugging Resources

- **Chrome Internals**: `chrome://` URLs for instant access to internal debugging pages
- **Crash Analysis**: Tools and techniques for understanding browser crashes
- **Performance Profiling**: Built-in tools for performance analysis and optimization

## Integration with Development

These debugging techniques integrate seamlessly with:
- [Architecture](../architecture/overview.md) understanding for system-level debugging
- [Modules](../modules/overview.md) specific debugging for individual components
- [Getting Started](../getting-started/overview.md) setup for debugging environment configuration
