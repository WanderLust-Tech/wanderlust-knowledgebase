# Progress Tracking System

Welcome to the comprehensive progress tracking system! This feature helps you monitor your learning journey through the Chromium knowledge base.

## Features Overview

### Reading Progress
- **Automatic tracking**: Progress is tracked based on scroll position and time spent reading
- **Article completion**: Articles are marked as complete when you reach 95% scroll progress
- **Time tracking**: Monitor how much time you spend on each article
- **Cross-session persistence**: Your progress is saved across browser sessions

### Learning Analytics
- **Weekly activity**: Visual charts showing your reading patterns over the past week
- **Category progress**: See how much you've explored in each content category
- **Reading streaks**: Track consecutive days of learning activity
- **Overall progress**: Get a bird's-eye view of your platform progress

### Learning Paths
- **Custom paths**: Create structured learning journeys for specific topics
- **Progress tracking**: Monitor completion of learning path articles
- **Estimated time**: Get reading time estimates for entire learning paths
- **Difficulty levels**: Organize paths by beginner, intermediate, or advanced levels

### Intelligent Recommendations
- **Continue reading**: Smart suggestions for articles you've started but haven't finished
- **Related content**: Discover articles based on your reading history
- **Category exploration**: Find new areas to explore based on your interests

## How It Works

### Automatic Progress Tracking

The system automatically tracks your reading progress using several methods:

1. **Scroll-based tracking**: As you scroll through an article, your progress percentage increases
2. **Time-based tracking**: The system records how much time you spend reading each article
3. **Completion detection**: When you scroll to 95% of an article, it's marked as complete
4. **Session management**: Your reading session is tracked from when you start reading until you navigate away

### Data Storage

All progress data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage, ensuring:
- **Privacy**: Your reading data never leaves your device
- **Performance**: Fast access to your progress data
- **Offline support**: Progress tracking works even when offline
- **Data portability**: Export and import your progress data

### Visual Indicators

You'll see progress indicators throughout the platform:
- **Progress bar**: At the top of each article showing reading progress
- **Time estimates**: Reading time estimates for articles and learning paths
- **Completion badges**: Visual indicators for completed articles
- **Streak counters**: Daily reading streak display

## Getting Started

### Access Your Dashboard

Click the progress icon in the header to access your **Learning Progress Dashboard** where you can:

- View your overall statistics
- See your reading history
- Manage learning paths
- Analyze your learning patterns
- Export/import your data

### Create Learning Paths

Organize your learning by creating custom learning paths:

1. Go to the **Learning Paths** tab in your progress dashboard
2. Click **"Create New Path"**
3. Add articles to your path
4. Set difficulty level and estimated time
5. Track your progress as you complete articles

### Monitor Your Progress

Each article you read will automatically:
- Show a progress indicator at the top
- Track time spent reading
- Update your overall statistics
- Contribute to your learning streaks

## Example Learning Paths

Here are some suggested learning paths to get you started:

### Beginner: Chromium Basics

2. Modules → JavaScript (V8)
3. Architecture → Design Patterns → All patterns
4. Contributing → Contributing Guide

## Privacy and Data

### Local Storage Only
Your progress data is stored entirely in your browser's local storage. This means:
- **No server tracking**: Your reading habits are completely private
- **No account required**: Start tracking immediately without signing up
- **Device-specific**: Progress is tied to your specific browser and device

### Data Export/Import
You can export your progress data to:
- **Backup your progress**: Save your data before clearing browser storage
- **Transfer between devices**: Move your progress to another browser or device
- **Share learning paths**: Export specific learning paths to share with others

### Data Management
Full control over your data:
- **Clear all progress**: Reset your progress tracking at any time
- **Selective deletion**: Remove specific articles or learning paths
- **Export anytime**: Get a JSON export of all your progress data

## Technical Implementation

The progress tracking system is built with:
- **React Context**: Centralized state management for progress data
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe interfaces for all progress data structures
- **localStorage API**: Persistent local storage for cross-session data
- **Scroll tracking**: Advanced scroll position monitoring
- **Time tracking**: Accurate reading time measurement

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient storage**: Minimal data footprint with optimized storage structure
- **Background tracking**: Non-intrusive progress updates that don't affect reading experience
- **Lazy loading**: Progress dashboard components are loaded only when needed
- **Debounced updates**: Progress updates are batched to prevent excessive localStorage writes

Start exploring the knowledge base, and watch your progress grow! The system will automatically begin tracking as soon as you start reading articles.
