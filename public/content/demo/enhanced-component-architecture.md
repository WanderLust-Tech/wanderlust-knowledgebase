# Enhanced Component Architecture Demo

This page demonstrates the modular, extensible article/component rendering system that supports multiple content types with consistent interaction patterns.

## Markdown Components

This is a standard markdown component that supports rich text formatting, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and interactive section bookmarks.

### Code Example

Here's some JavaScript code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// React Component Example
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="component">
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### Features

- ✅ **Syntax Highlighting**: Automatic code highlighting for multiple languages
- ✅ **Section Bookmarks**: Click the bookmark icon next to any heading to save it
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop viewing
- ✅ **Theme Support**: Supports both light and dark themes

## Interactive Components

The system supports various interactive content types:

### Code Editor
- Live code editing with syntax highlighting
- Multiple programming language support
- Run and reset functionality

### Simulations
- Interactive simulations with configurable parameters
- Real-time updates and controls
- Educational demonstrations

### Demos
- Step-by-step interactive demonstrations
- Progress tracking and state management
- Customizable configuration options

## Media Components

### Video Content
- HTML5 video player with custom controls
- Interactive captions and transcripts
- Thumbnail previews and metadata display
- Progress tracking and seeking

### Diagrams
- Multiple diagram types (Mermaid, PlantUML, Flowcharts, Architecture)
- Interactive elements with clickable nodes
- Fullscreen viewing mode
- Zoom and pan controls

## UI Components

### Callouts
Various callout types for important information:

- **Info**: General information and tips
- **Warning**: Important warnings and cautions
- **Error**: Error messages and troubleshooting
- **Success**: Success messages and confirmations
- **Tip**: Pro tips and best practices

### Quizzes
- Multiple choice questions
- True/false questions
- Code completion exercises
- Progress tracking and scoring
- Detailed explanations and feedback

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Modularity
Each component type is implemented as a separate, focused renderer that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

### 2. Extensibility
New component types can be easily added by:
1. Creating a new renderer component
2. Adding the type to the ComponentTypes interface
3. Updating the ComponentRenderer switch statement

### 3. Consistency
All components follow the same interaction patterns and design principles, providing a unified user experience.

### 4. Performance
- Lazy loading of component renderers
- Suspense boundaries for graceful loading states
- Optimized re-rendering with React.memo and proper dependency management

### 5. Developer Experience
- Type-safe component definitions
- Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- Development-time debugging information
- Extensive logging and analytics hooks

## Technical Implementation

The Enhanced Component Architecture consists of:

- **Core Types**: TypeScript interfaces defining component structure and content types
- **Component Renderer**: Main orchestrator that routes components to appropriate renderers
- **Modular Renderers**: Specialized components for each content type
- **Interaction System**: Consistent event handling and state management
- **Layout System**: Flexible layout and styling options

This architecture enables the creation of rich, interactive documentation that goes beyond traditional markdown while maintaining excellent performance and developer experience.
