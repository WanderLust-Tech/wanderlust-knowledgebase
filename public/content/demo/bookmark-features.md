# Bookmark Feature Demo

This page demonstrates the new bookmarking functionality in the Wanderlust Knowledge Base.

## Features Overview

The bookmarking system includes:

- **Page-level bookmarks**: Bookmark entire articles for quick access
- **Section-level bookmarks**: Bookmark specific sections and code blocks
- **Persistent storage**: Bookmarks are saved in localStorage
- **Search and filter**: Find bookmarks by title, description, or category
- **Import/Export**: Backup and restore your bookmarks
- **Smart categorization**: Automatic categorization based on content location

## How to Use Bookmarks

### Bookmarking Pages

1. Navigate to any page in the knowledge base
2. Look for the bookmark button with label in the top-right corner of the content
3. Click to bookmark the entire page

### Bookmarking Sections

1. Hover over any heading (h2, h3) or substantial code block
2. A small bookmark icon will appear on the left side
3. Click to bookmark that specific section

### Accessing Your Bookmarks

1. Click the bookmark icon in the header (shows count badge)
2. Use the search box to find specific bookmarks
3. Filter by category using the dropdown
4. Sort by date, title, or category
5. Click any bookmark to navigate directly to it

### Managing Bookmarks

- **Remove**: Click the trash icon on individual bookmarks or use the "Clear" button
- **Export**: Save your bookmarks as a JSON file
- **Import**: Load bookmarks from a previously exported file

## Code Example

Here's a sample code block that can be bookmarked:

```typescript
interface BookmarkFeatures {
  pageBookmarks: boolean;
  sectionBookmarks: boolean;
  persistentStorage: boolean;
  searchAndFilter: boolean;
  importExport: boolean;
  categorization: boolean;
}

const features: BookmarkFeatures = {
  pageBookmarks: true,
  sectionBookmarks: true,
  persistentStorage: true,
  searchAndFilter: true,
  importExport: true,
  categorization: true,
};

console.log('All bookmark features are implemented!', features);
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components

The bookmarking system consists of:

1. **BookmarkContext**: React context for state management
2. **BookmarkButton**: Reusable bookmark toggle component
3. **BookmarksPanel**: Full-featured bookmark management interface
4. **SectionBookmark**: Wrapper for section-level bookmarking

### Data Structure

Each bookmark contains:
- Unique ID and timestamp
- Page title and path
- Full URL for navigation
- Optional section information
- Category for organization
- Custom description

## Benefits

- **Quick Navigation**: Jump directly to important content
- **Personal Organization**: Create your own knowledge paths
- **Offline Access**: Bookmarks work even when offline (with PWA)
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Bookmarks survive browser restarts
- **Shareable**: Export and share bookmark collections with team members
