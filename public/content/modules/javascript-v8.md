# JavaScript (V8)

Chromium embeds Google’s high-performance V8 JavaScript engine to power all script execution in web pages and browser internals. This article explores how V8 fits into Chromium’s architecture, its compilation & execution pipeline, memory management, embedding APIs, and debugging tools.

---

## 1. Role of V8 in Chromium

- **Where it lives**  
  - In the **renderer process**, under `src/third_party/v8/`  
  - Blink calls into V8 via the **V8 embedder APIs** in `content/renderer/v8_*`  
- **What it does**  
  - Parses, compiles, and executes all JavaScript on web pages  
  - Runs extension & internal scripts (e.g. DevTools, PDF viewer)

      ↓
NATIVE MACHINE CODE
Parser & AST

parser.cc builds the Abstract Syntax Tree.

Uses “pre-parsing” to quickly skip heavy functions.

Ignition Interpreter

Bytecode generator (bytecode-generator.cc) produces compact bytecodes.

Interpreter (interpreter.cc) executes without initial machine-code compile.

Turbofan Optimizing Compiler

Hot functions are profiled, then passed through Turbofan (turbofan/)

Generates highly optimized machine code.

Deoptimization & On-Stack Replacement

If assumptions break (e.g. type change), deopt back to baseline.

3. Memory Management & Garbage Collection
Heaps & Spaces

Young Generation (Scavenge, Semi-Spaces)

Old Generation (Mark-Sweep, Mark-Compact)

Large Object Space

Incremental & Concurrent GC

Scavenges small heaps quickly

Marks & compacts old generation on background threads

Handles & LocalHandles

C++ wrappers ensuring safe pointer movement across GCs

4. V8 Embedding in Chromium
Isolates (v8::Isolate)

One per renderer process by default; isolates encapsulate heaps & contexts.

Contexts (v8::Context)

Execute code in separate global object environments (e.g. <iframe>).

Bindings & Templates

Native classes/functions exposed to JS via FunctionTemplate and ObjectTemplate.

Blink defines DOM APIs by wiring its C++ implementations to V8.

Microtasks & Promise Hooks

Chromium pumps the microtask queue between tasks to implement Promises.

5. Compilation & Startup
Snapshotting

Startup snapshot captures pre-compiled builtins & standard library for faster cold starts.

Build Flags

Controlled via GN args:

gn
Copy
Edit
v8_enable_pointer_compression = true
v8_enable_slow_dchecks = false
v8_static_rooting = true
Debug vs Release

Debug builds include extra checks, slower GC; release builds optimize for speed.

6. Debugging & Profiling
DevTools Protocol

V8 exposes the Debugger, Profiler, and Heap domains.

Connect via chrome://inspect or embed custom tools.

CPU & Memory Profiles

Capture JS call stacks, optimize hotspots in Turbofan.

Heap snapshots to find leaks.

Logging & Flags

bash
Copy
Edit
out/Default/chrome --js-flags="--trace-gc --trace-opt --prof"
External Tools

Heap Inspector, d8 shell for iterative testing.

7. Web Workers & Service Workers
Worker Contexts

Each worker spawns its own V8 isolate & event loop.

Shared ArrayBuffer & Atomics

Enables parallel JS with shared memory.

8. Compatibility & Standards
ECMAScript Versions

V8 keeps pace with ES6+ features: modules, async/await, proxies, BigInt.

WebAssembly

Integrated via wasm.cc modules; both interpreter and tier-up compilation.

9. Extending & Hooking In
Custom Builtins

Add new functions by extending V8’s builtins in src/third_party/v8/src/builtins.

Inspector API

Embed the Inspector protocol in other tools or integrations.

Flags & Experiments

Feature-flag new JS proposals before standardization.

10. Next Steps
Read Modules → Storage & Cache to see how JS resources (scripts, modules) are cached.

Explore Debugging → Debugging Tools for end-to-end JS debugging setups.

Clone and play with the d8 shell in third_party/v8/tools/d8 for hands-on experimentation.
