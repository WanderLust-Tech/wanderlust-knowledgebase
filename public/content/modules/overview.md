# Modules & Components

Welcome to the Modules section! This area provides detailed documentation about the core modules and components that make up the Wanderlust custom Chromium browser.

## What You'll Find Here

This section covers the major functional modules of our Chromium implementation:

- **[JavaScript V8 Engine](javascript-v8.md)**: V8 JavaScript engine integration and customizations
- **[Networking & HTTP](networking-http.md)**: Network stack, HTTP handling, and protocol implementations
- **[Storage & Cache](storage-cache.md)**: Storage systems, caching mechanisms, and data persistence
- **[Storage Cache Details](storage-cache/)**: In-depth storage cache implementation details

## Module Architecture

Our custom Chromium browser is built with a modular architecture where each module handles specific functionality:

### Core Engine Modules
- **V8 JavaScript Engine**: Handles JavaScript execution, optimization, and runtime management
- **Networking Stack**: Manages all network communications, HTTP/HTTPS protocols, and connection handling
- **Storage Systems**: Provides data persistence, caching, and storage management

### Module Interactions

Each module is designed to work independently while maintaining clean interfaces with other components:

- **JavaScript ↔ Networking**: Script-initiated network requests and responses
- **Networking ↔ Storage**: Caching network resources and managing cached content
- **Storage ↔ JavaScript**: Persistent storage APIs accessible from web content

## Understanding Module Documentation

Each module documentation includes:
- **Purpose and Responsibilities**: What the module does and why it exists
- **API Interfaces**: Public interfaces and integration points
- **Implementation Details**: Internal architecture and design decisions
- **Configuration Options**: Customizable settings and parameters
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization strategies and performance tips

## Development Guidelines

When working with modules:

1. **Understand Dependencies**: Review how modules interact with each other
2. **Follow Interfaces**: Use established APIs and avoid direct internal access
3. **Consider Performance**: Each module affects overall browser performance
4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break other modules

## Integration with Browser Architecture

These modules integrate with the broader browser architecture covered in:
- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/overview.md): System-level design and process model
- [Security Model](../security/overview.md): Security boundaries and sandboxing
- [Debugging Tools](../debugging/overview.md): Module-specific debugging techniques

## Module-Specific Resources

- **JavaScript V8**: Engine internals, optimization, and script execution
- **Networking**: Protocol handling, connection management, and network security
- **Storage**: File systems, databases, caching strategies, and data management
